### Install packages

By default, a Node.js project is empty, so we need to install a few packages with npm install. Let's start with a basic express server, body-parser for JSON handling, multer for file upload and, of course, APS.

:::caution
Run one npm install at a time.
:::

```bash
npm install express --save
npm install express-formidable --save
npm install multer --save
npm install cookie-session --save
npm install forge-apis --save
npm install autodesk.forge.designautomation --save
npm install body-parser --save
npm install form-data --save
npm install socket.io --save

```

> The --save parameter indicates that the module should be included in the package.json file as a dependency.

Finally open the package.json and, inside "scripts", add "start": "node start.js", line. Now your folder should have a `node_modules` folder and your `package.json` should look like this

```json title=package.json
{
  "name": "designAutomationSample",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "",
  "main": "start.js",
  "scripts": {
    "start": "node start.js",
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
  },
  "author": "",
  "license": "MIT",
  "dependencies": {
    "autodesk.forge.designautomation": "^3.0.3",
    "body-parser": "^1.19.0",
    "cookie-session": "^2.0.0",
    "express": "^4.17.1",
    "forge-apis": "^0.9.2",
    "form-data": "^4.0.0",
    "multer": "^1.4.5-lts.1",
    "socket.io": "^4.0.1"
  }
}
```

> The version number (e.g. forge-apis 0.9.2) may vary, it was the latest version when this tutorial was created.

### Files and Folders

To create a new folder or file, right-click on the "Explorer" area on the left and select New Folder or New File.

Create a `/routes/` folder for all server-side files and a `/wwwroot/` folder for all client-side files.

At this point, you project should have the following structure

<img src={VsCodeFolderExplorerImg} style={{ width: 300 }} />

This file indicates to Visual Studio Code how we should run our project. Go to menu Run >> Add Configuration... and, in the Select Environment window that appears on the top, choose Node.js. In the /.vscode/launch.json file that is created, enter the following

```json title=launch.json
{
  // Use IntelliSense to learn about possible attributes.
  // Hover to view descriptions of existing attributes.
  // For more information, visit: https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=830387
  "version": "0.2.0",
  "configurations": [
    {
      "type": "node",
      "request": "launch",
      "name": "Launch Program",
      "program": "${workspaceFolder}/start.js",
      "env": {
        "APS_CLIENT_ID": "your id here",
        "APS_CLIENT_SECRET": "your secret here"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

:::note
It's important to define ID & Secret as environment variables so our project can later be deployed online. More on this later, in Deployment.
