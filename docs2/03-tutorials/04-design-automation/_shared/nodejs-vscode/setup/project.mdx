Create a new folder for your project, navigate to it in the command line, and initialize a new
Node.js project:

```bash
mkdir designAutomationSample
cd designAutomationSample
npm init -y
```

Next, install all the Node.js dependencies we're going to use. In this case it will be
the [Express.js](https://expressjs.com) framework, an Express.js [middleware](https://expressjs.com/en/guide/using-middleware.html)
for handling `multipart/form-data` requests, and finally the [APS SDK](https://www.npmjs.com/package/forge-apis):

```bash
npm install --save express express-formidable forge-apis
```

The `"dependencies"` in your `package.json` file should now look something like this
(potentially with slightly different version numbers):

```json
// ...
"dependencies": {
    "express": "^4.17.1",
    "express-formidable": "^1.2.0",
    "forge-apis": "^0.9.1"
}
// ...
```
