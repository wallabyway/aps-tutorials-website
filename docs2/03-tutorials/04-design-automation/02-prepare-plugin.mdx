# Create Plugin

Design Automation uses `.bundle` just like the [Autodesk App Store](https://www.autodesk.com/developer-network/app-store), meaning you need to create a PackageContents.xml and a ZIP with the DLL (and other required files). For detailed information on how to create them, please visit Autodesk App Store Developer Center.

At this section we will create a basic plugin that update width and height parameter and save the resulting file. Also the supporting files (PackageContents.xml) and the folder structure to place them. Finally create a .ZIP file ready to upload to Design Automation.

In the root folder, create a `bundles` folder.

### Prerequisites

- 7zip: use to create the .ZIP with bundle files, please install from here. This tutorial assumes 7zip is installed on the default folder: `C:\Program Files\7-Zip\7z.exe`.

### Additional prerequisites

For the next session you can use the pre-build plugin. Or if you decide to build it, you will need

- **Visual Studio**: Visual Studio 2019 or newer is required, please visit [this link](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/).

- **AutoCAD, Inventor, Revit or 3ds Max**: In order to develop, test and debug your Design Automation plugin: [AutoCAD](https://www.autodesk.com/products/autocad/overview) | [Inventor](https://www.autodesk.com/products/inventor/overview) | [Revit](https://www.autodesk.com/products/revit/overview) | [3ds Max](https://www.autodesk.com/products/3ds-max/overview).

---

For the next step, choose the **Engine**, which is the Autodesk application where you plugin will run. You'll need the respective application installed in order to compile, debug and test locally.

### Choose the engine

<EngineTabs
  AutoCAD={AutoCADPlugin}
  Inventor={InventorPlugin}
  Revit={RevitPlugin}
  Max={MaxPlugin}
/>

### Upload Plugin Bundle

Now the ZIP bundle is ready, let's upload to Design Automation.

<EnvTabs
  NodeJsVsCode={BundleNodeJS}
  DotNetVsCode={BundleNet6}
  DotNetVs2022={BundleNet6}
/>

If you run the webapp now and click on Configure (top-right), you should see your AppBundle and a list of all available engines. Buttons do not work yet... let's move forward.
