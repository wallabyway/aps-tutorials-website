Create a new folder for your project, navigate to it in the command line,
and initialize a new Node.js project:

```bash
npm init -y
```

Next, install all the Node.js dependencies we're going to use. In this case it will be [dotenv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv)
(utility for initializing environment variables from a file), [Express.js](https://expressjs.com) (web framework),
an Express.js [middleware](https://expressjs.com/en/guide/using-middleware.html)
for handling cookie-based sessions, and finally the [APS SDK](https://www.npmjs.com/package/forge-apis):

```bash
npm install --save dotenv express cookie-session forge-apis
```

The `"dependencies"` in your `package.json` file should now look something like this
(potentially with slightly different version numbers):

```json
// ...
  "dependencies": {
    "cookie-session": "^1.4.0",
    "dotenv": "^16.3.1",
    "express": "^4.18.2",
    "forge-apis": "^0.9.4"
  },
// ...
```

Finally, let's create a couple more subfolders in your project folder that we're going to need later:

- `wwwroot` - this is where we're going to put all the client side assets (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images, etc.)
- `routes` - this is where we're going to implement all the server endpoints
- `services` - here we're going to keep all the server-side logic that can be shared by different endpoints
