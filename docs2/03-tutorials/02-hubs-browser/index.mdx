# Hubs Browser

## Introduction

In this tutorial we're going to build a APS application that will let us browse through the content
of our authenticated users in other APS-based applications such as [BIM 360 Docs](https://www.autodesk.com/bim-360/construction-document-management-software/),
[Autodesk Docs](https://www.autodesk.com/products/autodesk-docs/overview), or [Fusion Team](https://www.autodesk.com/products/fusion-360/overview).

:::note
Make sure to [provision access](../../01-getting-started/index.mdx#provision-access-in-other-products) to one of your ACC or BIM360 accounts
so that the application can see your projects, folders, and documents.

We will use the following components of the platform:

- [Authentication](https://aps.autodesk.com/en/docs/oauth/v2/developers_guide/overview)
- [Data Management](https://aps.autodesk.com/en/docs/data/v2/developers_guide/overview)
- [Viewer](https://aps.autodesk.com/en/docs/viewer/v7/developers_guide/overview)

:::tip
If you're not interested in building the application from scratch, and you just want to try
and run it locally, the complete implementation is available on GitHub:
- https://github.com/autodesk-platform-services/aps-hubs-browser-nodejs
- https://github.com/autodesk-platform-services/aps-hubs-browser-dotnet
