# Simple Viewer

## Introduction

In this tutorial we're going to build a simple APS application that lets us
upload, translate, and preview 3D designs and 2D drawings.

<Image img={PreviewUrl} />

We will use the following components of the platform:

- [Authentication](https://aps.autodesk.com/en/docs/oauth/v2/developers_guide/overview)
- [Data Management](https://aps.autodesk.com/en/docs/data/v2/developers_guide/overview)
- [Model Derivative](https://aps.autodesk.com/en/docs/model-derivative/v2/developers_guide/overview)
- [Viewer](https://aps.autodesk.com/en/docs/viewer/v7/developers_guide/overview)

:::tip
If you're not interested in building the application from scratch, and you just want to try
and run it locally, the complete implementation is available on GitHub:
- For Node.js: https://github.com/autodesk-platform-services/aps-simple-viewer-nodejs
- For .NET: https://github.com/autodesk-platform-services/aps-simple-viewer-dotnet
