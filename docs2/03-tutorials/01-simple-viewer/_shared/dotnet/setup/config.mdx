Create a `Startup.cs` file in the root folder of your project with the following content:

```csharp title="Startup.cs"
using System;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Builder;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Hosting;
using Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration;
using Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection;
using Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting;

public class Startup
{
    public Startup(IConfiguration configuration)
    {
        Configuration = configuration;
    }

    public IConfiguration Configuration { get; }

    // This method gets called by the runtime. Use this method to add services to the container.
    public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
    {
        services.AddControllers();
        var clientID = Configuration["APS_CLIENT_ID"];
        var clientSecret = Configuration["APS_CLIENT_SECRET"];
        var bucket = Configuration["APS_BUCKET"]; // Optional
        if (string.IsNullOrEmpty(clientID) || string.IsNullOrEmpty(clientSecret))
        {
            throw new ApplicationException("Missing required environment variables APS_CLIENT_ID or APS_CLIENT_SECRET.");
        }
    }

    // This method gets called by the runtime. Use this method to configure the HTTP request pipeline.
    public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app, IWebHostEnvironment env)
    {
        if (env.IsDevelopment())
        {
            app.UseDeveloperExceptionPage();
        }
        app.UseDefaultFiles();
        app.UseStaticFiles();
        app.UseRouting();
        app.UseEndpoints(endpoints =>
        {
            endpoints.MapControllers();
        });
    }
}
```

The `Startup` class is responsible for configuring our server and its "middleware", for example,
serving of static files. We also try and retrieve the APS application client ID and secret
from environment variables (or from other [configuration providers](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/configuration/?view=aspnetcore-6.0#configuration-providers))
for later use.

Now, to pass actual configuration values to our application for debugging purposes,
we will modify (or create) the _appsettings.Development.json_ file in our project folder
with the following content (replacing `<client-id>` and `<client-secret>` with your
APS Client ID and Client Secret):

```json
{
  "Logging": {
    "LogLevel": {
      "Default": "Information",
      "Microsoft.AspNetCore": "Warning"
    }
  },
  "APS_CLIENT_ID": "<client-id>",
  "APS_CLIENT_SECRET": "<client-secret>"
}
```

:::caution
Since the `appsettings.Development.json` file contains sensitive information, make sure that it is **not** included in git!
This can be ensured by adding the `appsettings.Development.json` line to the [.gitignore](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore) file.
