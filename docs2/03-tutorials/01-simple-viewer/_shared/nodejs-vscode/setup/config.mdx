Create a `config.js` file in the root of your project folder, and add the following code:

```js title="config.js"
require('dotenv').config();

let { APS_CLIENT_ID, APS_CLIENT_SECRET, APS_BUCKET, PORT } = process.env;
if (!APS_CLIENT_ID || !APS_CLIENT_SECRET) {
    console.warn('Missing some of the environment variables.');
    process.exit(1);
}
APS_BUCKET = APS_BUCKET || `${APS_CLIENT_ID.toLowerCase()}-basic-app`;
PORT = PORT || 8080;

module.exports = {
    APS_CLIENT_ID,
    APS_CLIENT_SECRET,
    APS_BUCKET,
    PORT
};
```

The `dotenv` library initializes environment variables from a local _.env_ file (if there's one).
We then simply read the environment variables from `process.env`, and exit the application
immediately if any of the required properties are missing. And if no bucket name is provided
for where our designs should be stored, we generate one by appending the `-basic-app` suffix
to our application Client ID.

:::caution
Note that the Data Management service requires bucket names to be **globally unique**,
and attempts to create a bucket with an already used name will fail with `409 Conflict`.
See the [documentation](https://forge.autodesk.com/en/docs/data/v2/reference/http/buckets-POST)
for more details.

Next, let's create the _.env_ file in the project folder, and populate it with the required
environment variables (replacing `<client-id>` and `<client-secret>` with your APS Client ID
and Client Secret):

``` title=".env"
APS_CLIENT_ID="<client-id>"
APS_CLIENT_SECRET="<client-secret>"
```

:::caution
Since the `.env` file contains sensitive information, make sure that it is **not** included in git!
This can be ensured by adding the `.env` line to the [.gitignore](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore) file.

Now, in order to be able to run and debug our application from Visual Studio Code, we need to create
a [launch configuration](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/debugging#_launch-configurations).
Use _Run > Add Configuration_ in the menu to create a new configuration, and when prompted
for the specific environment, choose _Node.js_. This will create a new `.vscode`
subfolder in your project with a `launch.json` file where you can define different
launch configurations. Replace the content of the file with the following:

```json title=".vscode/launch.json"
{
    "version": "0.2.0",
    "configurations": [
        {
            "type": "node",
            "request": "launch",
            "name": "Launch Server",
            "runtimeExecutable": "npm",
            "runtimeArgs": [
                "start"
            ],
            "skipFiles": [
                "<node_internals>/**/*.js"
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```

We are defining a single launch configuration called _Launch Server_ that will simply
start our application using the `npm start` command.
