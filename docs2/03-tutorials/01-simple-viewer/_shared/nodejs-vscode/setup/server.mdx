Create a `server.js` file in the root of your project folder with the following code:

```js title="server.js"
const express = require('express');
const { PORT } = require('./config.js');

let app = express();
app.use(express.static('wwwroot'));
app.listen(PORT, function () { console.log(`Server listening on port ${PORT}...`); });
```

For now the server isn't doing much, just serving static assets from the `wwwroot` subfolder
(which is currently empty), and reporting any errors to the console and back to the client.

Next, let's add a `"start": "node server.js"` script to the `package.json` file so that we can
easily run our application later:

```json
// ...
"scripts": {
    "start": "node server.js"
}
// ...
```
