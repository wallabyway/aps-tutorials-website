:::caution
Make sure you have _admin_ access to an Autodesk Construction Cloud (ACC for short) account
:::

1. Log into your ACC account, and navigate to _Account Administration_
  - From the overview of projects

<Image img={require('./project-list.jpeg')} />

  - From the user interface of a specific project

<Image img={require('./project-detail.jpeg')} />

2. On the _Account Admin_ page, go to _BIM 360 Admin_ > _Settings_, and navigate to the _Custom Integrations_ tab

<Image img={require('./account-admin.jpeg')} />

3. Use the _Add Custom Integration_ button on the left side to start a simple wizard
that will guide you through the process

4. On the _Select Access_ page, keep both the _BIM 360 Account Administration_
and the _Document Management_ options checked, and hit the _Next_ button

<Image img={require('../select-access.jpeg')} />

5. On the next page of the wizard, choose the _I'm the developer_ option, and hit
the _Next_ button

<Image img={require('../i-am-developer.jpeg')} />

:::info
Here we assume that the _account admin_ is also the owner of the APS application.
If that is not the case, the account administrator can use the _Invite a developer_
option instead, and the invited developer will input the APS application details later.
:::

6. On the next and final page, make note of the _BIM 360 Account ID_, check the
checkbox next to it, and fill out the _Client ID_ and the _App Name_ fields
exactly as they appear in your application's page on https://aps.autodesk.com/myapps

<Image img={require('../bim360-info.jpeg')} />

:::tip
Consider storing your client ID somewhere in _App Description_. The client ID will _not_
appear in the custom integration after it has been created, and if the number of integrations
in your account starts to grow, this will help you quickly identify the APS application
each custom integration is associated with.
:::

7. When ready, scroll down and hit the _Save_ button

After completing the process, your application will be able to use different APS services
such as [Data Management API](https://aps.autodesk.com/en/docs/data/v2/developers_guide/overview)
or [ACC API](https://aps.autodesk.com/en/docs/acc/v1/overview/introduction)
to access information from all projects under this ACC account.
