# Getting Started

Here's a couple of things you want to do before building your first
[Autodesk Platform Services](https://aps.autodesk.com) application.

## Create an account

If you don't have an APS account yet, sign up for one on https://aps.autodesk.com.

:::tip
You can take advantage of a trial subscription that is valid for 3 months.

## Create app credentials

In order to authenticate ourselves to the APS platform, we will need to generate
_app credentials_ (specifically, a _client ID_ and _client secret_) for our application.
After logging into the developer portal, go to your profile menu in the top-right corner,
and click on _Applications_:

<Image img={require('./_shared/developer-portal-logged-in.png')} />

Next, click on the _Create application_ button:

<Image img={require('./_shared/my-apps.png')} />

Enter the name of your application. Select the type of application that applies to you, and click the _Create_ button:

<Image img={require('./_shared/create-app.png')} />

And your application is now ready. Let's store your _Client ID_ and _Client Secret_
credentials as we will need these soon!

Finally, set the _Callback URL_ under _General Settings_ to `http://localhost:8080/api/auth/callback`,
and enable the APIs you want your application to have access to. Unless you have any specific reason
for limiting your application's access to the different services, enable everything.

:::caution
Pay close attention to the _Callback URL_. This is the address your application's
users will be redirected to after logging in with their Autodesk credentials. It can be
any arbitrary URL but it has to match exactly the URL your server application expects.
In our tutorials we will always use the same address: `http://localhost:8080/api/auth/callback`.

Finally, update the application by clicking on the _Save changes_ button, and you're all set!

## Provision access in other products

In certain cases it is possible for your application to integrate with other APS-based products
such as [Autodesk Construction Cloud](https://construction.autodesk.com),
or [Autodesk BIM 360](https://www.autodesk.com/bim-360). We leverage this capability in
the [Hubs Browser](./tutorials/hubs-browser) tutorial where you can learn about accessing designs
from [Autodesk Docs](https://www.autodesk.com/products/autodesk-docs/overview),
[BIM 360 Docs](https://www.autodesk.com/bim-360/construction-document-management-software/),
or [Fusion Teams](https://www.autodesk.com/products/fusion-360/overview).

However, some of these products must _provision access_ for a specific APS application
based on its client ID. Follow the steps below for any specific product you would like
to integrate your application with.

:::info
If you are _not_ planning to integrate your application with other products for now,
you can skip the rest of this page and come back to it later when needed.

No provisioning steps are needed. Your APS application can automatically access
the data of your authenticated users in this product.
